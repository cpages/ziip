Ziip
====
A simple cross-platform clone of Zoop

Currently Linux and Wii are supported.

You can grab the latest source code in the github repository here:

=====================
Compiling and Running
=====================

Linux
-----
You'll need SDL, SDL_image, SDL_ttf and SDL_gfx.
Copy or simlink Makefile.linux to Makefile and run make:
$ make
and run it with:
$ ./ziip

Controls:
cursors: direction
space: select/fire
q: quit


Wii
---
You'll need the devkitPPC toolchain, as well as the SDL Wii port. You can find
instructions on how to get and install them here:
    - http://wiibrew.org/wiki/SDL_Wii

If you're under Linux, copy or symlink Makefile.wii to Makefile and run make:
$ make
If you're not, you'll have to improvise a bit :)

To run it, you'll first need some data on the SD card
data -> sd:/apps/ziip/data
fonts -> sd:/apps/ziip/fonts

If you have wiiload configured, you can run it with:
$ make run

I hope to make it easier soon.

Controls:
Wiimote:
dpad: direction
A, 1, 2: select/fire
home: quit

Gamepad classic:
dpad: direction
a, b, x, y: select/fire
home: quit
