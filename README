Ziip
====
A simple cross-platform clone of Zoop

Currently Linux, Wii and Windows are supported.


===========
Source Code
===========
You can grab the latest source code in the github repository here:
http://github.com/cpages/ziip


==============
Known problems
==============
The network game modes are not completed and probably never will. Under Linux
it can be played over network, but on the Wii there seems to be issues with the
SDL_net implementation and I'm too lazy to look at it. Under Windows I never
tried.


=====================
Compiling and Running
=====================
To compile ziip under any platform you'll need CMake. Additionally, you'll need
SDL, SDL_image, SDL_ttf, SDL_net and SDL_gfx.

Linux
-----
Go to the ziip folder and create a build folder as with any cmake project.
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
Tweak any cmake options (build type basically)
If you want to run it locally (without install), set USE_LOCAL to ON and then
compile as usual:
$ make
and run it with:
$ ./ziip
(alternatively you can make install, it should work :)

Controls:
player1
cursors: direction
space: select/fire
q: quit

player2
joystick


Wii
---
You can download it from teknecal's homebrew browser, but if you really want to
compile it, here's how to do it:

You'll need the devkitPPC toolchain, as well as the SDL Wii port. You can find
instructions on how to get and install them here:
    - http://wiibrew.org/wiki/SDL_Wii

If you're under Linux, use cmake and invoke it like
$ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/toolchain-powerpc-eabi.cmake ..
Tweak any cmake options (build type basically) and compile as usual:
$ make

To run it, you'll first need some data on the SD card
data -> sd:/apps/ziip/data (src is not needed)
fonts -> sd:/apps/ziip/fonts
user -> sd:/apps/ziip/user

Controls:
Wiimote:
dpad: direction
A, 1, 2: select/fire
home: quit

Gamepad classic:
dpad: direction
a, b, x, y: select/fire
home: quit


Windows
-------
Should be the same as with Linux, basically use CMake.
